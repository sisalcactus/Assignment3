# Assignment 3

# 1. Loading and sampling from the dictionary ####
dictionary <- read.table("dictionary.txt", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)  # this is needed to read and load the dictionary (from which the secret keyword is selected)
keyword <- sample(dictionary$V1, 1)                                   # this is needed to sample a random word from the dictionary

# 2. Prompting the player to start the game ####
print(paste("Welcome to Hangman! This word has", nchar(keyword), "letters. Type 1 letter to begin your guess. You are allowed 10 guesses. Note that you will LOSE a try for guessing the same letter again (since you're given all letters you've inputted with each new guess)."))
                      # nchar() is needed to determine and display the number of characters of the word
                      # this print() function is needed so instructions and rule are displayed as a message

# 3. Setting the conditions for when the game starts/restarts ####
i <- 10               # this is an arbitrary value to concisely represent the number of tries left (10 at the beginning of the game)

right_guesses <- c()  # this creates a new vector, allowing us to later update the repertoire of guesses the player has already correctly made with each new guess
wrong_guesses <- c()  # this creates a new vector, allowing us to later update the repertoire of guesses the player has already incorrectly made with each new guess

# 4. Creating the loop for the game to take place continuously until the player wins or loses ####
while(i>0){           # setting i as greater than 0; this way, the reader will stay in the game (from being prompted to enter a letter to winning or losing) until they run out of tries (i equalling 0 means 0 tries left)
  
  repeat{
    guess <- readline(prompt = "Please enter a letter: ")   # this is needed to prompt the player to enter a letter (denoted by "guess")
    if ((grepl("[A-Za-z]", guess)) &                        # this is needed to validate if the input is a letter from a to z (upper and lower case okay)
        (nchar(guess) == 1)){                               # this is needed to check that the input is exactly 1 letter
      break                                                 # this is needed to let the player exit the repeated prompt (i.e., to enter a letter) only when they've met the above 2 conditions
    }

  guess <- as.character(guess)                              # this is needed to ensure the input as a character so it matches the letters in the keyword (also characters)

  wrong_guesses <- unique(append(wrong_guesses, guess_nocaps[!guess_nocaps %in% keyword_letters])) # this is needed to update the vector of incorrectly guessed letters each time the player makes a new guess so we can display, after each guess, all letters incorrectly guessed so far

  # the above if-else block (the outer if...else) is to check if the guessed letter is in the secret keyword
  # if it is, we want to a) tell the player they guessed correctly and b) use the which() function to tell them the spot (through indexing) in the keyword that the letter is in (e.g., "h" is in spot 2 of the keyword "shield"); we also tell them the identities of correctly and/or incorrectly guessed letters
  # if it is not, we want to tell the player they did not guess correctly and deduct a try each time they input a letter not found in the keyword; we also tell them the identities of correctly and/or incorrectly guessed letters

  # paste0() is chosen as we don't want a space between keyword and the period in the displayed message
} # the while loop ends here as we only want the components inside the loop to repeat (and only display the next and final message when the player has won or lost)
print("Play again.") # this is displayed to prompt the reader to play another round regardless of whether they win or lose
